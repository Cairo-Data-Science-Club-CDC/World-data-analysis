# Introduction

This book contains a series of mini projects to learn data science using world data from different sources.


Exploratory data analysis of total world population, regions, and countries.

Where to find world data? Many!

Primary sources:

-   [International Database (IDB)](https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/#/country?COUNTRY_YEAR=2022&COUNTRY_YR_ANIM=2022) from the United States Census Bureau provides population estimates and projections for 227 countries and areas.

-   [World Population Prospects 2022](https://population.un.org/wpp/) from the United Nations is the latest assessment considers the results of 1,758 national population censuses conducted between 1950 and 2022.

Secondary sources:

-   [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd003/) foundation collects data from different resources on world population from 1800 to 2100.

-   [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth) brings together the most reliable and informative data sets.
